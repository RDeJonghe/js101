// **UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM**
// - Inuput
// - Output (is the original mutated or returning new collection?)
// - Rules
//     - Restate explicit requirements
//     - Identify implicit requirements
// - List Questions

// **EXAMPLES / TEST CASES**
//  - Look at what example input and output is, consider exceptions/differences

// **DATA STRUCTURES**
// - How you interact with data when you implement

// **ALGORITHM (PROCESS / SET OF STEPS FROM INPUT TO OUTPUT)**
// - Start general first with plain words, do a general process of steps without specific details of methods, code words. Can do that later. Think abstractly, avoid implementation details, those come later.

// **CODE (IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION IN CODE)**
// - Think about solution and algorithm in the context of the programming language being used







// FULL NOTES:

// **UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM**

// - Make sure to identify input and output
// - Rules
//     - Restate explicit requirements
//     - Identify implicit requirements
// - List Questions
//     - Think through the problem and list questions, things to define better

// **EXAMPLES / TEST CASES**

// - Helps to confirm or refute our assumptions about the problem
// - Helps to answer questions about implicit requirements
// - Here make sure to ask about specific cases
// - Look at what example input and output is
//     - Consider exceptions/differences in input output (integer or floating point numbers for example)

// **DATA STRUCTURES**

// - How you interact with data when you implement
// - This is closely linked to the algorithm, the data structure is part of the process (algorithm set of steps from input to output). Structuring data in a certain way is part of the set of steps also.
// - 

// **ALGORITHM (PROCESS / SET OF STEPS FROM INPUT TO OUTPUT)**

// - A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing task/objective
// - Steps to structure the data a certain way to get desired output (so related to data structures)
// - Start general first with plain words, do a general process of steps without specific details of methods, code words. Can do that later. Think abstractly, avoid implementation details, those come later.

// **CODE (IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION IN CODE)**

// - Think about solution and algorithm in the context of the programming language being used
// - Translate solution to code
// - Language features / constraints
// - Consider built in functions / methods that can be used
// - Syntax / coding patterns
// - Create test cases if we don't have them
// - Code with intent
// - Don't try to problem solve at the code level. Go back to the PEDAC and think abstractly. Can switch between implementation and abstract thinking, can also move to different parts of PEDAC as needed.
