// Build a program that randomly generates Teddy's age, and logs it to the console. Have the age be a random number between 20 and 120 (inclusive).

// Teddy is 69 years old!

// create a function that takes no parameters
// set an age variable = Math.Floor(Math.Random) multiply 10  - then add 20, adding 20 will make sure it's at least 20

let age = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 20;

console.log(`Teddy is ${age} years old!`)
