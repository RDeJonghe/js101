// Practice problem 3 from lesson 4

console.log([1, 2, 3].map(num => num * num));

// The following code differs slightly from the above code. What is the return value of map in this case? Why?

// This will work because of implicit return, it's a simple single line function without curly braces so it will return an array with the numbers multiplied

// If you were to put in curly braces it wouldn't work
