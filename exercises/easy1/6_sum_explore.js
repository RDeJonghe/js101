// Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks whether the user wants to determine the sum or the product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer, inclusive.

/*
Further Exploration
What if the input was an array of integers instead of just a single integer? How would your computeSum and computeProduct functions change? Given that the input is an array, how might you make use of the Array.prototype.reduce() method?
